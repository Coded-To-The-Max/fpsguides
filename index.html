<p><h3>What is An FPS?</h3>
- FPS or First Person Shooter are a specific type of game that are in the first-person perspective that usually involve guns but can involve melee such as knives as well. 
FPS games are very popular and have been around for decades. Recently, they have blown up in popularity especially over the pandemic.
Specifically, they are known as eSports or electronic sports. They can usually be played casually and competitively.

<p><h3>Why Would You Want To Get Better?</h3>
- Getting better or good at FPS games can be very beneficial; both for fun and for the competitive spirit. 
More specifically, getting better at famous or uprising games competitively, you have high chances of going semi-professional or even full-time professional. 
Another reason for some people is that they feel accomplished climbing ranks in Competitive modes. It's also more fun to be able to understand the game and play well at the same time; satisfying in a way. 
There are a lot more reasons but these are the key ones.

<p><h3>How Can I Trust You?</h3>
- You can trust me because I almost / could have went semi-professional if I wanted to but I didn't because I wanted to focus on school. I've played with multiple professionals in Competitve mode in a recent shooter, VALORANT. I've experienced many things first-hand so you can trust what I say is first-hand experience.
</p>
<p><h3>Common Issues & Problems</h3>
- This is what I hear the most in these type of games: "It's all my teammates fault, I'm playing well every game but I keep losing!" First, if you are playing well every game and still losing there's more to it than just your teammates. A lot of problems can be the reason why: first, you could be 'baiting' your teammates, for example: you are always the last person to enter / you don't go in with your team. 
Realistically, you would get more 'kills' than your teammates but you will usually be losing the round anyways because it's very difficult to 1 versus X amount of people. 
Therefore, even if you end with many kills, they were not <i>impactful</i> kills.
<br><br>
- "I can't get better! I'm stuck in (this rank)!" For many, this is because they don't have the heart in actually improving their skills and getting better. Moreover, having the motivation to actually get better and actively working towards it, I guarantee you will see progress, slowly or fast.

<p><h3>External Apps That <i>MAY</i> Help</h3>

- Aimlabs: Aimlab is an app that you can download for free that is basically an aim training service. To be honest, I believe it doesn't help that much. (but that is my opinion) I will give them credit that they have a lot of the training needed to excel in FPS games, from tracking skills to precise reaction time and mouse movement. It is purely personal preference but I can't guarantee this.
